# Le-Net-5 notebooks

This section describes the notebooks which processes Le-Net-5 experiments.
They can be foun in `notebooks/lenet_compression` folder.
The folder contains folowing items:

- `lenet_genetic_compression.ipynb` - notebook implementation of layer-wise Weight-Sharing optimization by Genetic algorithm on Le-Net-5.
